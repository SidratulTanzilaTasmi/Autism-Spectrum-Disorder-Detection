# Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Detection
This repository contains the processed dataset for my paper published in ICCIT 2023.
In this project, I have performed machine learning analysis of different algorithms for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder based on behavioral symptoms and other associated factors. The target labels in the dataset were 3, which were the intensity of ASD based on severity.
DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.14884452.v3
Steps for processing the dataset include: Dealing with missing values, feature selection, and dataset balancing.
Machine Learning Models Used:
SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, CatBoost, Decision Tree, Passive Aggressive Classifier, Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression etc. 
I hope this processed dataset can be used by enthusiastic researchers for application of detection of severity of ASD and learn on how to perform performance analysis of machine learning on any dataset.
